🎮 Pac-Man Game (Java Swing)

Welcome to my implementation of the classic Pac-Man game using Java Swing! 
This project is a fun and educational attempt to recreate the retro arcade experience while practicing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles like encapsulation, inheritance, interface and polymorphism.
✨ Features:

    Smooth 2D graphics built using JPanel and custom drawing.

    Directional movement with collision detection.

    Four colored ghosts (Red, Blue, Pink, Orange) that move autonomously.

    Collectibles:

        Regular food pellets.

        Bonus fruit that appears every few seconds and disappears if not eaten.

    Sound effects for:

        Eating food 🍒

        Colliding with ghosts 👻

        Game over ☠️

    Scoring and life system.

    Full game reset after game over (with score/lives reset).

    Classic Pac-Man tunnel wrap behavior.

🧱 Technologies Used:

    Java (JDK 8+)

    Swing for GUI

    Custom SoundLoader & ImageLoader for audio and image resource handling
